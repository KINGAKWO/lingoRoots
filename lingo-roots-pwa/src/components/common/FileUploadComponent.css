/* 
  FileUploadComponent.css
  Use this file for any custom CSS that cannot be easily achieved with Tailwind CSS.
  For example, complex animations, pseudo-elements not fully supported by Tailwind's JIT, 
  or very specific overrides.

  Most styling should be done directly in the JSX using Tailwind CSS classes for consistency
  and to leverage the utility-first approach.
